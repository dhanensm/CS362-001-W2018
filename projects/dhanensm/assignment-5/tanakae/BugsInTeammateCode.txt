CAUGHT BY: test02b( ) ApptRandomTest.java
	   test06b( ) ApptRandomTest.java
ISSUE: isValid( ) returned true rather than false when an entered start hour was greater 
       than 24 or less than zero, so all values of startHour are accepted
SEVERITY: medium 

FOUND: appt.java representationapp( ) line 280
CAUGHT BY: test05b( ) ApptRandomTest.java
ISSUE: an inequality was reversed, which caused the hour times greater than 11 to get am 
       rather than pm (and vice versa)
SEVERITY: medium

FOUND: appt.java compareTo( ) line 306
CAUGHT BY: test10b( ) ApptRandomTest.java
ISSUE: the start hours should be subtracted to find the difference between the two values 
       but they are added, which will always return a number greater than or equal to 0
SEVERITY: medium

FOUND: timetable.java getApptRange( ) line 38
CAUGHT BY: test03b( ) TimeTableRandomTest.java
ISSUE: all appointments are out of range because the if statement is entered if the 
       last day is after the first, when it should be negated and only be entered if the 
       last day is before the first.  The rest of the code cannot execute with this error.
SEVERITY: high
